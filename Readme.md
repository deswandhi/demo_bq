   ```sql
   # SQL Script to Display Data Source Info
   SELECT
     *
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.samples.natality`
   LIMIT
     10
   ```
2. **Complex Query Example:**
   - Demonstrate a complex SQL query for data preparation and cleansing.
   ```sql
   # SQL Script for Complex Query
   SELECT
     source_year AS year,
     COUNT(is_male) AS total_births
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.samples.natality`
   WHERE
     source_year > 2000
   GROUP BY
     year
   ORDER BY
     year
   ```
3. **Advanced Analytics:**
   - Showcase BigQuery's ability to perform advanced analytics like aggregation and grouping.
   ```sql
   # SQL Script for Advanced Analytics
   SELECT
     gestation_weeks,
     AVG(weight_pounds) AS avg_weight
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.samples.natality`
   WHERE
     gestation_weeks IS NOT NULL
   GROUP BY
     gestation_weeks
   ORDER BY
     gestation_weeks
   ```

### Step 4: Transition to Looker Studio Demo
#### Script:
"Now, let's explore Looker Studio and see how it complements BigQuery for creating interactive and insightful dashboards."

#### Technical Narrative:
1. **Introduce Looker Studio:**
   - Access Looker Studio's user-friendly interface.
   - Mention drag-and-drop functionality and dashboard creation.
2. **Create Interactive Dashboard:**
   - Demonstrate creating a sales trends dashboard using the `bigquery-public-data.samples.natality` dataset.
   - Drag and drop elements like charts and graphs.
   ```sql
   # SQL Script for Looker Dashboard
   SELECT
     source_year AS year,
     COUNT(is_male) AS total_births
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.samples.natality`
   WHERE
     source_year > 2000
   GROUP BY
     year
   ORDER BY
     year
   ```
3. **Customization and Deployment:**
   - Customize dashboard layout, colors, and widgets.
   - Deploy the dashboard for sharing with teams.

### Step 5: Seamless Integration and Workflow Benefits
#### Script:
"BigQuery and Looker Studio seamlessly integrate, empowering data analysts like Sarah to streamline their workflows and derive actionable insights."

#### Technical Narrative:
1. **Integration Overview:**
   - Seamless connection between BigQuery datasets and Looker's dashboards.
   - Instant updates in Looker with changes in BigQuery data.
2. **Workflow Benefits:**
   - Easy transition between data exploration in BigQuery and visualization in Looker.
   - Time-saving in data preparation, analysis, and sharing insights.

### SQL Queries:
Here are the modified SQL queries using the `bigquery-public-data.samples.natality` dataset:

1. **Data Source Information:**
   ```sql
   # SQL Script to Display Data Source Info
   SELECT
     *
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.samples.natality`
   LIMIT
     10
   ```

2. **Complex Query Example (Sales Trends):**
   ```sql
   # SQL Script for Complex Query
   SELECT
     source_year AS year,
     COUNT(is_male) AS total_births
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.samples.natality`
   WHERE
     source_year > 2000
   GROUP BY
     year
   ORDER BY
     year
   ```

3. **Advanced Analytics (Average Birth Weight by Gestation Weeks):**
   ```sql
   # SQL Script for Advanced Analytics
   SELECT
     gestation_weeks,
     AVG(weight_pounds) AS avg_weight
   FROM
     `bigquery-public-data.samples.natality`
   WHERE
     gestation_weeks IS NOT NULL
   GROUP BY
     gestation_weeks
   ORDER BY
     gestation_weeks
   ```

### Summary:
In this part, we introduced the challenges faced by data analysts like Sarah, such as dealing with massive datasets, scalability issues, and the need for advanced analytics tools. We then introduced BigQuery and Looker as solutions to these challenges. The technical script includes SQL queries using the `bigquery-public-data.samples.natality` dataset to showcase BigQuery's capabilities in handling large datasets and advanced analytics. Next, we transition to Looker Studio to demonstrate its intuitive dashboard creation and visualization features. Finally, we highlight the seamless integration between BigQuery and Looker, emphasizing the workflow benefits for data analysts.
